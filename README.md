# SScompare_hashes
Compare hashes found with Sysmon+SIEM to hashes found in VirusShare repository

This script was developed to be used with QRadar SIEM and RedHat OS, so you may need to make some adjustments to use it with other SIEMs. The core idea remains the same, and adapting it shouldn't be too difficult. Perhaps ChatGPT could help you with the adaptation ;)
